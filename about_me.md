# About T.K.

Currently in the 5th year of my PhD, I'm am looking for post doc positions!


My day is often spent writing and debugging MATLAB code.
But when I'm not at work, I spend some time volunteering at the clubhouse at [Computers4Kids](https://computers4kids.net/) and playing violin with the local [Crozet Community Orchestra](https://crozetcommunityorchestra.org/).
