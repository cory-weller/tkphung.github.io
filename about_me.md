<center><img src="/assets/img/TK_cavman.jpg" width="300" height="375"></center>

Currently in the 5th year of my PhD, I'm am looking for post doc positions!


My day is often spent writting and debugging MATLAB code. However, I also enjoy spending time eating [pie](http://thepiechestcville.com/), [pizza](http://www.bennysva.com/BennyDelucas), and liking [french bulldog](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/frenchbulldogs/) posts on instagram. I also play violin with the local [Crozet Community Orchestra](https://crozetcommunityorchestra.org/).
