## Computational Modeling to Guide Cardiac Therapies
My PhD work has explored the development and use of computational mechanical models to test therapies in the heart:

- Predicting [the effect of various catheter ablation patterns on left atrial function using a coupled finite-element and hydraulic circuit model](https://doi.org/10.1111/pace.13086)

- Combining [multimodal imaging to build personalized left ventricle models](https://simtk.org/projects/lvdatamap) for [clinically guiding cardiac resynchronization therapy](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03398369)

- Developing fast, patient-specific electro-mechanical model of the left ventricle to predict mechanics following cardiac resynchronization therapy
