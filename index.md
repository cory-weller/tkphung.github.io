My name is T.K. Phung. I am a PhD student in the [Cardiac Biomechanics Group](http://www.bme.virginia.edu/holmes/) in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia. My work at UVA has involved developing computational electrical and mechanical models to guide therapies in the heart.
